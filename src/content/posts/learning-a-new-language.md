# Learning a new language : Mistakes I've made and how I do it now

Learning new things is a big part of every developer journey, most of us learn new things almost everyday. In an industry that is in constant motion, we have to adapt. Existing tools might change, new tools are always getting released all over the place, it's not about knowing about all of them, but about knowing enough about the tools that you use most and that are more relevant to you. It is also a good and refreshing experience to go out of your comfort zone and try out other tools to see how they solve the same problems we all are trying to solve.

## A little story about me
When I was in college, I genuinely believed that the quality of a software developer came with the number of languages in which the said developer can program. So, in pursuit of greatness, I started learning a new language every week. "Learning" . My method at that time was very simple:
- Pick a language
- Read the first page of the docs
- Program hello word
- Make a goofy guessing game or some basic program in the console
- NEXT!!!

This is not learning, at least not in my opinion.

A year later, I finally learned while talking with a senior dev, that my conception of a good software developer was wrong. He told me to pick a language, stick to it and get very good at it. I did my googling and finally picked JavaScript.

Learning JavaScript was different. I bought Angela Yu's web development course on Udemy and started grinding like a mad man. I picked up a coffee addiction during that period, I was skipping school, sleeping like 5 hours a day just because I wanted to quickly finish the course so I can call myself a "Fullstack web developer". I finally stopped at the section about React and started building my own projects. I learned much more that way, not because of Angela's course, the way she teaches is fantastic, I was the one taking the course like a mad man, while being high on coffee and lacking sleep almost all the time.

3 months after I started "learning" JavaScript I got the opportunity to work on an ecommerce projoect as a freelancer. At that time I was fully confident in my JavaScript/NodeJS knowledge, but it was right then, that the reality check hit me for the first time. I don't remember exactly how, but it was a bug related to objects being passed by reference, I didn't know, and I didn't know how I didn't know. Now I know why : I didn't learn JavaScript, I didn't know JavaScript, I knew it enough to make some simple apps, but not enough to work on a real project.

After that experience, I did a lot of copium, which ultimately led me to switching to TypeScript. And after some express servers and some goofy frontend apps, I was confident enough to call myself a TypeScript developer. Even though I was less confident than I was after my JavaScript journey.

## Learning Rust saved me
When I heard about Rust for the first time, it was from ThePrimeagen. I immediatly wanted to learn it, Prime is very good at making me want to use everything he uses, I made the switch from vscode on windows to neovim+tmux on Arch thanks to him (Yes, I use Arch **BTW**). So I installed Rust, popped the documentation and I was shocked when 3 hours later I couldn't even write a simple guessing game without looking at the docs and copy-pastaing. I gave up. A few days later I tried again, but gave up again. I thought Rust was just built different and was not for me. Then I started googling about How to learn Rust and many of the answers were pointing towards The Rust book, so that's what I finally did. I read the book, slowly, one page at a time, I read and read and read, then went on Exercism to practice what I've read. One month later, I was able to write my guessing game in one shot without the compiler giving me any warning or error. I was so proud of myself, I felt great.

Rust taught me a great way of learning a language. I hate Python but that's what I use at work, I didn't even learn Python. But I can make things work in it, that does not mean I know Python. After the Rust experience I really started to question my skills because of the way I got them. I realized I wasn't good, at least in my own opinion, call it impostor syndrome but I call it reality check. 

## How to akshually learn a language
Quick answer : **By taking the time to learn it**. I like this incredible article called "Teach yourself programming in 10 years", which I will link at the end of the post. Why are we such in a rush? if you are learning a language, then take the time to actually learn it. Start from the basics and slowly move up. Naturally some languages will be easy/difficul to learn based on the type of language(s) you have mostly been using, and that's fine. Rust was that hard for me because I was coming from a JS/TS "background" . And I could argue that people say Python is easy just because they learn the easy part and consider they know everything, even tho let's be honnest, Python is pretty easy to learn.

If I had to learn a language now, this is how I would do it:
- Get familiar with the syntax and the language

Every language is unique, take the time to get familiar with what makes it unique. A very good way to do this without getting bored is by solving problems, small problems one at a time. Try something like Exercism or Advent Of Code (my personnal favorite). By solving these problems you will get a good overview of the language basics such as error handling, loops, ifs, and much more. And during that phase don't forget that Google is your friend. Well, chatgpt is also your friend, but I would say be careful in the way you use it to learn, don't let it write all the code for you and copy pasta.

- Build some project(s)

Once you feel comfortable with the language syntax and paradigms, try to build something. Anything, but start with something simple and goofy. I work mostly in web development so most of the time for me it would be a basic web server. By building a project you will get familiar with the language ecosystem, the tools available, the package manager...

After that you would normally start to get decent at the language, that's when you build something more ambitious. Something more complex, yet again I work in web development, and I have many project ideas, so I would try to make one of my projects 
come alive. Something that will have at least the same level of complexity you would face in the real world.

I know this sounds like a deja vu, but the thing that should make the difference is the time you put in each steps. Don't watch a "Learn X in 24 hours" video and decide you know the language. You don't, maybe you know it enough to make some simple things work, but that doesn't mean you know it.

Software developers are more productive when they work with a language they love, if you happen to fall in love with the language you are learning, then good for you, keep on using it, building projects, and get as good as you can possibly get at it. Know the language, know the good things and the bad things about it.

## Final words
I am currently learnig Golang and Rust. More Golang than Rust because I want to change my carrier path (can't keep on using a language I hate at work). I'm still in the phase 1, doing Advent Of Code, and I really wish I learned TypeScript/JavaScript this way. 

I would really like to hear your take in this subject :) Consider starring this gist if you agree with me and follow me on GitHub to receive 69 years of good luck **right now**!!
