Hello there. Welcome to my blog, I am [thewisepigeon](https://github.com/TheWisePigeon) and in today's post, I want to discuss my relation with my impostor syndrome. It has been a crucial part of my life
for the last year and yesterday I watched a youtube video (will be linked at the end of the post) which ultimately led me to write this post. I wish you a good read :)

> Impostor syndrome, also known as impostor phenomenon or impostorism is a psychological occurrence in which people doubt their `skills`, `talents` or `accomplishments`
and have a persistent internalized `fear` of being exposed as frauds. Despite external evidence of their competence. those experiencing this phenomenon do not believe
they `deserve` their success or luck.

During the first ever "face to face" interview I did in my life, I was asked "Why you? Why not the other applicants?", I said "I am not talented, but I am passionate, and because of
that I am ready to work much harder than those who might be talented or feel like they are". "How do you know you are not talented?" He asked me. I could not answer. It was a feeling
inside me, I couldn't explain it with words. I just said "I know". 
To be honest that's something I planned to say before going into the interview but it was a genuine answer. Even though I did projects, even tho I knew a lot of stuff, and was able to 
talk with the interviewer about technical stuff like it was nothing, knowing I had 0 prior experience, I still felt goofy inside.
Even now that I have roughly 2 years of experience and have done pretty complex projects for a junior dev, I still feel that goofyness. 
And to be honest, I am happy it's still there.

I like to say I'm married to hard work, because it's the only thing that works for me. It's a never ending loop. I am always challenging myself to see if I am THAT good. But "THAT" good
is not even THAT good, if that makes sense. Working hard, is the only way for me to satisfy the monster that is my impostor syndrome. After all, I created that monster, I needed something
that would keep me hungry for skills, hungry for more skills, something that even when I will be doing okay in my carrier, will still be there to tell me that I am goofy.

I like this quote because it explains perfectly how I feel about my impostor syndrome. I am thankfull for having it because as long as it's there, I will keep pushing forward, but I know
I will miss some opportunities because it will be seen as lack of confidence instead of a reason to be better. But, the good thing about it is that when, eventually, it goes away, I will be as 
good as I always wanted to be, which I don't think will ever happen... but I am fine with that eventuality.

As `Eleanor Roosevelt` said
> You gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You must do the thing which you think you cannot do.

"You think you cannot do", it's just a thought, you don't know if you can do it, talented people will assume they can, but me, as a self proclaimed goofy developer, I have to push myself over
that thing many times before I can be comfortable with the thought that I CAN in fact do it. And even then, I will have to keep that thought alive, somehow in my brain, because if I don't, next 
time I will have to do that thing, it(the impostor syndrome) will come screaming in my ears "You cannot do that, you are too goofy." and then the loop will start again, I will have to go back
and "learn" that thing again, and prove to myself that I can do it. It's so fricking beautiful to me.

`Vincent van Gogh` said it better
> If you hear a voice within you say 'you cannot paint,' then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced.

What I really meant to say through this article is that it's okay to have an impostor syndrome, it can be harmful in many ways, but it can also be a helping hand. 

"The Whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts". So if like me you got a huge impostor syndrome, just treat it 
like it was your mistress, a necessary evil, that brings it's portion of good and bad in your life. Try to find the balance.

I already know I will live with this voice in my head for years to come, and it's pure joy to me. Plato said "I am the wisest man alive for I know only one thing and that is that I know nothing".
I am pretty sure he knew a damn lot of things, it just wasn't enough for him, he was in pursuit of a greater knowledge. And for I who claim to be not just a wise, but THE wise pigeon, I will gladly
pursue greater knowledge and keep on doing it until the day I cannot hear that voice in my head. Then I will proclaim "Non amplius stultus sum" ( 'I am goofy no more' in latin)

Thanks for reading this mess of a post. Hope you enjoyed it :) see you in the next one.
